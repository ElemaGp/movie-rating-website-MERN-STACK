        title: "Living",
        desc: "Bill Nighy is a fun, uninhibited actor, but there's an abashed, melancholy quality to him that hasn't been fully explored until 'Living,' a drama about a senior citizen reckoning with his life. Nighy became an unlikely star playing a dissolute, clownish old rocker in 'Love, Actually,' and he's been aces in a series of character parts and second leads ever since. You never find unnecessary or inorganic flourishes in his acting: he's a pro who goes in and gets it done, whatever the role's parameters. He's an active listener whose characters seem to be having their own thoughts on everything happening. His unassuming presence makes you feel at least some affection for whomever he's playing, even if they're coded as unsympathetic. The post-World War II London drama 'Living' puts Nighy at the center of a story: he plays Williams, the head of the Public Works Department, who receives a terminal health diagnosis and, after a period of shock, begins taking stock in his life and essentially trying to be the best person he can before he goes. It's a role that calls for subtlety, and director Oliver Hermanus has the right leading man. Williams is an archetypal figure: a bowler-hatted functionary for the state who's been doing the same thing and living the same life forever. Nighy is 73, old enough to have grandparents who were adults in the 19th century. He seems to understand from firsthand observations that people of different centuries (or parts of centuries) had different energies and ways of comporting themselves than those born 50 or 100 years later. You can picture Williams as someone for whom automobiles and planes were staggering new developments and who has seen so much change in his life that stability has become increasingly important. "

        title: "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery",
        desc: "The best bits in “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” are the ones you won't read about in this review (and hopefully won't hear about before you see the movie). But rest assured that they are plentiful, and they're scattered generously throughout Rian Johnson's uproarious if slightly inferior sequel. The clever details, amusing name-drops, and precisely pointed digs at vapid celebrity culture keep Johnson's movie zippy when it threatens to drag. In following up his 2019 smash hit “Knives Out,” the writer/director has expanded his storytelling scope in every way. Everything is bigger, flashier, and twistier. The running time is longer, as is the time frame the narrative covers. But that doesn't necessarily make “Glass Onion” better. A wildly entertaining beginning gives way to a saggy midsection, as Johnson's mystery doubles back on itself to reveal more details about these characters we thought we'd come to know. The result feels repetitive. The percolating tension that existed within the classy confines of the first “Knives Out” has lessened here against the sprawling, sun-dappled splendor of an over-the-top, private Greek island. And it would just be tough for Johnson to top his original film, which was so smart and singular—hilarious, but also legitimately suspenseful. His characters felt richer (no pun intended) the first time around, and his ensemble cast had more to do across the board. “Glass Onion” offers some meaty and meaningful performances, particularly from Janelle Monáe, Kate Hudson, and Daniel Craig, once again doing his best Foghorn Leghorn impression as the intrepid detective Benoit Blanc. And several of his high-profile cameos are a giddy delight. But multitalented actors capable of daring, exciting work, such as Leslie Odom Jr. and Kathryn Hahn, frustratingly go to waste in underdeveloped supporting parts. Still, if you can catch “Glass Onion” in its one-week theatrical run before it streams on Netflix starting December 23, it's a film that benefits from the collective energy of an enthusiastic audience. Plus, it'll help you avoid any spoilers that might dribble out over the next month. So: here goes!"

        title: "No Bears",
        desc: "“Astonish me!” was the directive that the great dance impresario Serge Diaghilev gave to those who hoped to work with him. It is also what we demand of our best filmmakers. The Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who's now, to the best of our knowledge, in a prison serving a six-year sentence on charges that don't amount to a hill of beans in any world that makes sense, is a world-class filmmaker whose work has not astonished like this in some time. Not entirely his fault, of course. Making films in Iran is never easy, and Panahi has been subjected to constant harassment from the country's government throughout his career, to the point that he was officially forbidden from making films, and essayed a 2011 work, depicting his house arrest, pointedly titled “This Is Not A Film.” As I observed in a review of his 2015 “Taxi,” “necessity and courage have been the mothers of his cinematic invention.” But the fruits of that invention, enlightening and dispiriting in equal measure, took on a predictable tinge over time. “No Bears” is a picture that’s in keeping with his recent work—circumstances deemed that it just had to be—but one that breaks away from it in ways that yield a work of, yes, astonishment. The movie begins with a scene that seems to be from the sort of conventional narrative film Panahi has never really quite made. A man, Bakhtiar (Bakhtiyar Panjeei), summons his girlfriend, Zara (Mina Kavani) from her waitressing duties with good news. He’s gotten her a passport—under a different name—and booked a flight for her to Paris. She’s less than thrilled by the news and dead set on their leaving the country together, not separately. The scene is fraught until the instruction to cut comes not from the actual site of shooting but from a man at a laptop. That man is Panahi. The director here plays a more overtly fictionalized version of himself than he has in his most recent films. In “No Bears” he has decamped from Tehran to the Iranian village of Joban, near Turkey. His crew is across the Turkish border—Panahi is legally enjoined from leaving Iran—and he is directing his new film remotely. And soon he faces the very prosaic problem of his Wi-Fi going out. He asks one of his hosts for a ladder, in an ultimately quixotic attempt (at least for the time being) to restore his signal. That villager informs him of an interesting ceremony taking place in the village, a prelude to marriage. Panahi feels he needs to keep incognito but is intrigued; he loans one of his cameras to the villager and gives him instructions on how to shoot. Panahi then perfunctorily takes a couple of snapshots. From this point on, “No Bears” runs on parallel tracks that seem to multiply even as a definite sinking feeling sets in. The story of Bakhtiar and Zara turns out to be a kind of experiment for director Panahi, a reconstruction of a real-life event. And the recording of the ceremony that Panahi passed on opens an entire can of worms in the village. Persian hospitality is legendary and practically sacrosanct, but in one conversation with some of the elders of Joban, one of them says, “I wonder, with all of the beautiful villages around Tehran, and all the nice weather, why would you come to this village so close to the border?” Panahi the artist aims to be a truth teller, but he finds himself practically obligated to prevaricate at every turn."

        title: "Corsage",
        desc: "Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Vicky Krieps) is getting dressed. Because she is a 19th-century empress, that means being dressed by attendants, but the one she wants is not there. With their hair in tight buns and white aprons tied with big bows, the maids pull Elisabeth's corset strings as tightly as they can, writing down the day's waist measurement. But Elisabeth tells them to call for Lotti, the only maid who can pull those strings a little bit tighter. The title of the film is 'Corsage,' not as in the flowers pinned to the bodices of prom attendees and mothers of brides but as in the German word for a corset, the stiff 19th-century undergarment, often fortified with bones, laced to constrict a woman's body so that it would conform to an idealized hourglass shape with a tiny waist. The sumptuous settings, elegiac tone, and Krieps' layered performance bring us into the world of this woman caught between the expectations of her culture and her own desires. The real-life Elisabeth married Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1854, when she was 16, making her Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary. She has been portrayed in opera, ballet, a 1950s Austrian film trilogy, and a Netflix series called 'The Empress.' The tragic murder-suicide of her son, the heir to the throne, and the woman he loved but was not allowed to marry was the subject of the 1968 movie 'Mayerling.' A noted beauty, her appearance was her primary concern. Today she might be diagnosed as anorexic or bulimic. She weighed herself as often as three times a day and severely restricted what she ate, often fasting for days.  In this unabashedly fictionalized version, the corsage/corset serves as a metaphor symbolizing the constrictions of a life of privilege but no power. Within her small sphere, she can make demands of her ladies-in-waiting. But outside of her rooms, she is constantly being told what to do by her husband and her son. Over and over, we see her testing restrictions within the limits of her situation. She is told she must make an appearance at a formal event, the emperor pointedly noting that she has been criticized for not spending enough time in Hungary. She arrives, but then she faints. While anyone whose corset is laced so tightly it is difficult to breathe might faint from lack of oxygen, she knows how to fake a swoon. Elisabeth has only limited control over her activities and relationships. But she is most concerned about the helplessness we all face: time and aging. 'At 40, a person begins to disperse and fade' if all meaning comes from how she is perceived. Politics and threats on all sides bound the power of an empress. But the power of beauty is less subtle and less complicated for the brief time it is there. That is something any actress understands, which may be why Krieps is not only the star but the producer of this film."

        title: "The Pale Blue Eye",
        desc: "One thing a movie watcher might not be looking for during the actual bleak midwinter is more bleak midwinter on the screen. Full disclosure: “The Pale Blue Eye,” written and directed by Scott Cooper and starring his frequent collaborator Christian Bale, set in New York’s more-rugged-than-today Hudson Valley in 1830, is thoroughly suffused with bleak mid-winterness. Masanobu Takayanagi's cinematography sometimes reproduces a gorgeous kind of grayscale, broken up by flashes of blue water and the blue uniforms of the cadets of the West Point Military Academy, the then-fledgling institution at which much of the story’s action is set. The chilliness fits the story of course. At the Academy, a cadet, named Fry, is discovered not just dead—by hanging, it is first presumed—but with his heart cut out. The extremely spooked overseers of the school, fearful of scandal that might strike a death blow to the place, enlist a retired lawman to investigate. Augustus Landor, played by Bale, is a solitary “cottager,” a widower whose not-quite-adult daughter left his home a couple of years prior. He likes to drink, has a sleeping partner in a warm-hearted tavern owner (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and is prone to melancholy despite his dry wit. He is reputed to have once gotten a confession from a criminal using nothing more than a “piercing look.” Removing the hearts of corpses—there will be another—is suggestive of quite a bit. And soon Landor is sniffing into matters of devil worship. One cadet who’s been observing the detective doesn’t find that lead a credible one. The killer, he insists, was “a poet.” This cadet is one Edgar Allan Poe, a sensitive outcast among militaristic braggarts and of course a future poet himself. Uncannily played by Harry Melling, who was similarly haunting in “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” Poe is taken under Landor’s wing. The duo takes a particular interest in the academy’s doctor, Daniel Marquis (Toby Jones), and his family. This clan could give the Addamses a run for its money. Mrs. Marquis is given to breaking the household china at less than a moment’s notice. Daughter Lea (Lucy Boynton) plays the piano beautifully and is very breathy and suffers from what is referred to here as “the falling sickness.” Of course, Edgar falls in love with her—all the other boys at West Point have as well. Lea observes that Edgar’s morbidity suits him well, and he in turn recites to her his poetic meditations on “Lenore.” The story's title is derived thereof."

        title: "Joyride",
        desc: "True to its title, Emer Reynolds' 'Joyride' holds both the thrills of getting away with something and the emotional crash that follows a burst of adrenaline—a mood killjoy, if you will. Fortunately, it's in this sweet-hearted movie's favor that the highs are stronger and more enjoyable than the lows. It may not come together as smoothly as the best feel-good movies of its kind, but there's an unwieldy charm to 'Joyride' that makes the trip memorable. At a cancer memorial fundraiser for his mom, 13-year-old Mully (Charlie Reid) catches his dad James (Lochlann O'Mearáin) stealing donations. It's for the family, he insists, but Mully isn't convinced. He snatches the wad of bills and takes off, jumping into a cab and driving away with it. Until that is, there's a snore from the backseat and then a baby's cry. He unintentionally picked up Joy (Olivia Colman), an uptight solicitor on her way to give her new baby away to her sister. Both on the run from painful memories, hurtful parental figures, and at some point, local authorities, Mully and Joy make unlikely travel companions as they sort themselves out. Reynolds, an experienced editor-turned-director, and writer Ailbhe Keogan thread a thin line between the pair's heartbreaking confessions and the various bumps on the road. Some detours are funny, some are somber, and a few are a bit off-kilter, like a street parade where people in intimidating burlap costumes dance around Mully at a delayed, dreamy speed. He's not dreaming, nor under the influence; it's just a surreal moment, complete with an oversized babydoll head being carried in the street. It's a bit on-the-nose overall, but not as much as a contrived moment on a plane when Joy is trying to leave, and the passengers rally around her like in a classic romantic comedy. Unfortunately, some of these stranger moments between heartfelt scenes throw off the tone and feel like ideas imported from another movie. However, other visual qualities of Reynolds' 'Joyride' are more holistic. Her collaboration with cinematographer James Mather creates a vivid sense of the Irish countryside and seaside. The film keeps gorgeous details of a foggy day as the characters walk among endless green hills and stalks of barley bouncing in the wind. As they wait to take the ferry, the blueness of the water seems to leap off the screen. The sun enters a window with a lovely glow in a boarding house's kitchen. Even if an emotional scene may be tough to watch, their images are usually eye-catching. The heart and soul of 'Joyride' are the two mismatched travelers brought to life by Reid and Colman's performances. Although plenty world-weary after landing with his self-absorbed father, Mully still has childlike moments of rebellion and innocence. In one tender moment at a gas station, he plays with a musical, dancing toy, and he mimics its moves. Joy watches from afar while holding her baby and smiles as if both taking in the silly moment and perhaps thinking of her own baby's future playtime. In a sense, she is haunted by her mother's lifelong antipathy and is afraid she will similarly fail this child she doesn't want. Colman's body language here is not too dissimilar to Charlie Chaplin's the Tramp in 'The Kid,' acting as if almost physically allergic to holding a baby, let alone keeping it. Absent a maternal figure like Mully's, Joy sometimes relies on Mully for caretaking advice since he has experience watching over younger relatives. They are both grieving their lost mothers and learning to step up for the sake of others. "

        title: "Babylon",
        desc:"Damien Chazelle is obsessed with the punishing pursuit of perfection. Whether it's finding an immaculate tempo, hurtling into space, or making it big in Hollywood, his films feature characters who are willing to endure physical and emotional torture to reach the finish line. If 'La La Land' was his wide-eyed, sentimental look at the movie machine, 'Babylon' feels like a very intentional counter to the criticisms of that film. It's a lavish 1920s-period piece about how often the silver screen images that feel like magic are really the product of incredibly hard work, broken dreams, and a lot of luck. Multiple sequences in 'Babylon' detail how much work goes into two seconds of film, whether it's a field of dozens of extras sitting around while a camera is obtained or the difficult perfection needed when recording sound. Those two excellent scenes remind us that none of this is easy, even if it all looks so much fun. Is it all worth it? That's the tough question. Chazelle gives lip service to the idea that this version of landing on the moon is worth the trip, but he drags his characters and the viewers through so much misanthropy to get there that it's hard to believe him. 'Babylon' is a film of stunning parts—both individual scenes, performances, and tech elements—but it feels like the magic touch that Chazelle needed to pull them together in an honest way eludes him. There's something to be said about a film being so robustly unapologetic, but I felt as manipulated and deluded as the outsiders in this film who are eaten up by the Hollywood machine by the time it was over. One might argue that's intentional—a 'feel bad' Hollywood movie is rare—but it's the difference between pulling back a curtain and simply rubbing your face in elephant shit. And that's how 'Babylon' opens, introducing us to Manny Torres (Diego Calva), a Mexican American in the city of angels at the end of the silent film era. He's trying to get an elephant to an insane Hollywood party, the kind of drug- and sex-fueled affair that was only whispered about in the gossip rags of the time. Chazelle uses the orgiastic bacchanal to introduce his players, including an aspiring actress perfectly named Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), who catches Manny's eye just as her star is about to rise. We also meet the suave Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), a silent film star about to leave his third wife and be struck by the fickle finger of fame as talkies come into the picture and the wheel turns to a new era of stars. There's a jazz trumpet player named Sidney (Jovan Adepo) and the underwritten role of a cabaret singer named Lady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li). Gossip journalist Elinor St. John (Jean Smart) writes about it all while recognizable faces like Lukas Haas, Olivia Wilde, Spike Jonze, Jeff Garlin, and even Flea flirt on the edges of the story. It's an undeniably ace ensemble, led by another fearless turn from Robbie and a star-making one from Calva, but Pitt is the stand-out, conveying a sense of lost glory that sometimes feels almost personal. Pitt has been a star for over 30 years—he's seen legends like Jack Conrad come and go, and he imbues his performance with a relatable melancholy that gives the entire film depth that it could have used in a few more places. Chazelle's ambitious tapestry approach focuses on the ascending arcs of the outsiders—Manny, Sidney, and Nellie don't understand they're part of a system that values them about as much as it does the equipment it needs to shoot the films (maybe less). Even the star Jack Conrad will discover how disposable legends can be. All of them become power players in their own way—Nellie holds the screen in a way that few actresses other than Robbie could convey convincingly; Sidney's musical talent ascends as sound takes over the silents; Manny is clearly one of the smarter people on a set, and that grants him an increasing number of decisions. There's an underdeveloped love story between Manny and Nellie, but this film is more about the love of movies and Hollywood history than romance. It is also loaded with an overwhelming blend of historical detail and urban legends. Chazelle clearly did his homework."

        title: "The Big 4",
        desc: "Indonesian director Timo Tjahjanto makes movies that embrace the absurd potential of filmmaking. I remember being a kid and hearing someone say that the best action movies show you something you've never seen before and you're not sure is even possible. Tjahjanto believes in a chaotic, comedic approach to action filmmaking, which reached its career peak for him in the riveting 'The Night Comes for Us,' a big enough hit for Netflix that they asked the madman to make another action extravaganza and he delivered 'The Big 4,' a shoot-'em-up with its director's unmistakable flair for the ridiculous. Critics have often compared well-choreographed action in films like 'The Killer' or 'John Wick' to ballet, films where every movement feels precisely considered for the best impact. Tjahjanto's films have a more reckless energy to them. Even though they're just as carefully considered, they maintain something closer to slapstick. It's like The Three Stooges with bazookas. 'The Big 4' is way too long and talky, but you feel its impact when it explodes. 'The Big 4' opens with one of its best scenes as Tjahjanto reminds us of his horror background by dropping viewers into an orphanage used to harvest organs for rich people. It turns out that the heroes of this tale are already undercover in this grotesque establishment, and they destroy all of its employees in an increasingly grotesque fashion. A sniper's bullet doesn't just drop an enemy in a Tjahjanto film—it blows half his head off. During the sequence, we meet the quartet of vigilante assassins that give the film its title: leader Topan (Abimana Aryasatya), the intense Alpha (Lutesha), marksman Jenggo (Arie Kriting), and the youngest Pelor (Kristo Immanuel). These angels have a Charlie in Petrus (Budi Ros), who decides it's time to retire from the team as his daughter Dina (the excellent Putri Marino) is retiring from the police academy. It's hard to lead a group of people who operate outside the law when your offspring is now the law. But Petrus can't enjoy his retirement and is murdered in what is basically the film's prologue, sending his four assassins to a remote island. Three years later, Dina tracks them down, and so does the killer of her father (Martino Lio), who now has a whole team to enact his vengeful will. 'The Big 4' is at its best when it's at its most ludicrous, whether it's the striking opening showdown or a wonderful later scene in which Topan has to ward off a pair of villains behind a door without revealing the violence to Dina. Lio leans into his villain role with fantastic facial hair, a silly number of knives sheathed on his body, and a fashion sense that seems built around his snarl. Most people who watch 'The Big 4' will be drawn to its cartoonish action, but the cast is solid from top to bottom, especially Lio, Marino, and Aryasatya. I'll admit to caring less and less about the plot of 'The Big 4,' which makes its 141-minute runtime a bit much. But all is forgiven when it finally takes off, which it does with enough rhythm to get you from the intense prologue to the insane final half-hour, during which Tjahjanto pulls out all the stops. He's reportedly hoping that this will be the start of a franchise. It's hard to imagine how the sequel could go bigger, but I bet he'll find a way. On Netflix now."

        title: "Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody",
        desc: "About 25 minutes into 'Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,' an inarticulate, slapdash musical biopic about the famed songstress, the film reaches its high point: Arista Records head Clive Davis (Stanley Tucci) enters the nightclub where Houston (Naomi Ackie) and her gospel legend mother Cissy Houston (Tamara Tunie) are performing. When the latter sees the A&R man taking his seat, she fakes losing her voice, clearing the way for her daughter to sing 'The Greatest Love of All.' Her vocals climb, soaring to the familiar majestic heights that catapulted her toward stardom. We watch Davis watch her. In one close-up, you can almost imagine dollar signs dancing around his head. The scene is so stirring one woman in my screening pulled out a lighter and waved her flame to the rhythm of Houston's unforgettable vibrato. During that brief scene, you can imagine 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody' gravitating toward a clear-eyed narrative about the annihilation of a voice, talent, and person by flattening her identity for the commodification of an image. But in working with an unfocused script by Anthony McCarten ('Bohemian Rhapsody'), director Kasi Lemmons flounders when rendering the woman beyond the tabloid cliff notes of her life. 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody' takes great pains to craft an intuitive throughline for Houston's life, as we briefly open in 1994 at the American Music Awards before flashing back to 1983 in New Jersey. But how Lemmons ultimately maneuvers back to the AMAs makes little emotional or logical sense. Still, for a short time, we're ready to absorb the saga with Lemmons. We see Houston (her friends call her 'Nippy') meeting and forming a lesbian relationship with Robyn Crawford (Nafessa Williams)—Lemmons should be complimented for not avoiding this portion of the singer's personal life. Houston eventually signs with the steadfast Clive Davis, takes advice from her parents Cissy and the selfish patriarch John Houston (Clarke Peters) to tone down her butch image in lieu of becoming America's princess. Soon enough, she begins racking up hits. Unfortunately, these scenes rush by, to the point that their brusque speed fools you into believing that Lemmons is merely trying to get to the real story she wants to tell. But that story never arrives. Instead, the film hops and skips through the highlights of Houston's career: making the music video for 'How Will I Know,' choosing the demo tape of the titular 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody' from Davis' pile of cassettes, and performing 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at Super Bowl XXV. All the while, hampered by her drug addiction, her relationship with Crawford frays. Instead, she chooses her image, career, and desire for Bobby Brown (played by Ashton Sanders, who gives the R&B singer a bundle of tics and a vocal cadence alarmingly close to DMX)."

        title: "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish",
        desc: "“Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the “Shrek” universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He’s a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land—but he’s also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. “The Last Wish” expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original “Puss in Boots.” Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado’s film. The film’s aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss’ whiskers blowing in the wind, “The Last Wish” offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. The story begins with a debauched bacchanal (featuring kegs filled with leche) that’s more convincing than the opening orgy in “Babylon.” Puss in Boots is naturally front and center, singing his heart out, partying it up—but eventually, he must go on the run when he realizes that bounty hunter The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) is after him, and he’s down to the last of his nine lives. (The zippy montage revealing the many ways he’s died is packed with witty, little asides.) FYI for parents and caretakers of little kids: The Big Bad Wolf is essentially The Grim Reaper. He’s relentless, and he’s terrifying. Faking his death, Puss seeks shelter at a cramped cat refuge run by Randolph’s sweetly doting Mama Luna. Watching the arrogant, preening feline struggle to assimilate into a mundane world of dry food and shared litter boxes is hilarious, and the angles through which we experience his reluctant transformation put us inside his head. But it’s here that Puss meets an unlikely ally: a scruffy, crazy-eyed Chihuahua pretending to be a cat because he has nowhere else to go. We come to know him as Perrito, and he’s played with scene-stealing sweetness by Harvey Guillen (“What We Do in the Shadows”). In a stacked voice cast, Guillen’s performance emerges as the unexpected highlight. Perrito’s unflappable innocence and enthusiasm in the face of danger are infectious, but he also provides the film with some of its most deeply emotional moments. Again, the darker parts of “The Last Wish” may disturb young viewers."
